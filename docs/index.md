# Setup

Set your environment with a config file in the base folder

To start the composer install will setup most of your starter scripts

~~~
composer install
~~~

look in setup/templates to see what is made to begin with.

Also .gitignore has a mix of ignored files that are for environment specific settings and to prevent overwrites during install.
Remove the files from there that you do want to keep in your workflow. [better setup coming soon]

Lastly setup migration examples and bower

~~~
bin/phpmig migrate
php setup/seed.php
bower install
~~~
